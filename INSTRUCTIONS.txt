The Clothing_Recommendation.ipynb file i.e. the python notebook contains the implementation of the complete process from pre-processing the data, till recommending the URLs for the product.

The Clothing_Recommendation.py is the python file for the same.

clothing_data is the Un-pre-processed dataset, and clothing_data2 is the pre-processed data.

Recomendation_Function.py is the function that takes input_text from the user and returns the output URLs. Its is a part of Clothing_Recommendation.ipynb and Clothing_Recommendation.py file.

Tried to deploy the same on google cloud function but its giving an error, as the main.py function is not given the dataset as an input over there, but no problem, still working on it.
